Marsyas was wise satyr that challenged Apollo to music tournament. Marsyas software is simple utility to edit metadata of songs so mp3 players could display them correctly.

Inside the scripts folder, there are two scripts. One is to edit the metadata of a single file, and the second is to edit a batch of files. To use them:

1. Call edit_single_file.py
* Pass the data to the input
 
2. Call edit_batch.py "path/to/folder"
* Pass the data to the input
